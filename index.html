  <!-- BIOGRAPHY AND WHY I JOINED ALT SCHOOL -->
   <section>
    <h2>About myself and why i joined AltSchool Africa:</h2>
    <p>I'm a goal-driven and passionate person with a strong desire to make a positive impact in the world. <br>
    Born to the family of Mr & Mrs Ashonibare  in Idiroko town, Ogun state, Nigeria. <br> Before relocating to lagos for my secondary school education, I had developed a keen interest in tech, even though i didn't know what it was back then. I've always loved it when i watch sci-fi movies with my parent and there is always a nerd guy behind the computer hitting keyboard at high speed and hacking and creating technologies for the hero, I will always tell my dad that i want to become that guy and he'd smile. <br>Throughout my academic journey, I've been fortunate to have had opportunities to explore my passion and develop little skill through watching youtube tutorials and videos, until one day i stumbled upon AltSchool Africa's page <br>
  Looking through the website, I instantly knew this is what I've been looking for. I'm currently enrolled in the School of Engineering program at ALT School, where I'm excited to further develop my skills and knowledge in Frontend Engineering.</p>
